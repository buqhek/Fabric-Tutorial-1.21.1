# Minecraft 1.21.1 Fabric Tutorial

Introduction to learning **_java_** and the **_fabric API_** in order to learn how to make minecraft mods.

### **Motivation:**

I have always enjoyed playing modded Minecraft and I thought I would take the knowledge I've learned in school so far to build something I've always wanted to. 

This repo will be implementing an item, and block, and will be for Minecraft 1.21.1. I hope to continue learning after this long after finishing this tutorial, and have this be the stepping stone into something much greater.

This project will remain public so I can ask for help and receive anonymous feedback on my style so that I may improve as much as possible through the community.

### **Credit/Sources**
Everything done here is thanks to [Kaupenjoe]((https://linktr.ee/kaupenjoe))'s [tutorial](https://youtu.be/oU8-qV-ZtUY?si=A5rsTwOmj60DuNg-) for Fabric 1.21.1. If it wasn't for his videos and help with documentation, I would not be able to learn what I did.
